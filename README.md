# endurance_v1
Original version of my Godot game, Endurance

This repo is mainly used by me to steal- I mean borrow some of my old code from. If you want to use it (I don't know why you'd want to), go ahead.

EDIT 3/1/2023 - I am archiving this repo since I think there's no point in leaving this project I will never commit any edits to again open. It will remain public and read-only.
